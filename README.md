# whats_in_your_pantry

This repo is for the Hufflepuff group of the UT Austin Bootcamp 2021-2022 winter session (TA - Max Wilets)  

For this first group project, our product "What's in your pantry?" will be a site that allows users to input some of the ingredients they found in their pantry and find recipes that contain those ingredients. Home cooks typically do not struggle to cook when their pantry is full, but once they have a collection of unused ingredients it can be difficult to actually come up with something tasty from scratch. Our site helps home cooks with gathering delicious recipes to cook using the last ingredients in their pantry.


AS A Home Cook I WANT to be able to find delicious recipes that utilize the remaining ingredients in my pantry or refrigerator so that they do not go to waste.

GIVEN I will INPUT the ingredients I currently have into the site, THEN I will receive recipes that contain those ingredients.
